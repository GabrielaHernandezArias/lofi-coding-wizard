# How to get started with this music app

To use/download the project into your own laptop, follow these steps:
- click on "code <>" in git hub and copy the SSH (it should be https://github.com/GabrielaHernandezArias/lofi-coding-wizard.git)
- open your command terminal as an admin
- "cd" into the directory you want to store this code in
- run: git clone https://github.com/GabrielaHernandezArias/lofi-coding-wizard.git myMusicApp
- no need to run "git init" since that is used to create a new git folder. "git clone" already takes care of this

### Notes 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
If any additional errors come up, feel free to google the errors and leverage stackoverflow answers. You might run into issues if you don't already have npm installed or react installed
To clarify, this music app is a locally-hosted website

### Learn More React
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
I would personally recommend the "developedbyjed" website, which is where i took this online class! :)
