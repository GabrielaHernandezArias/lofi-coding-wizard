# Welcome to the lo-fi coding wizard! ðŸ§™ 

### Basics 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The skeleton of this music app was built thanks to the online class "developedbyJed" on React-Redux

## How to run this project

Download the code repo (git clone), cd to 'lofi-coding-wizard', and run ``npm start``

This runs the app in dev mode, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

``npm build`` would build the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build. 

This is how the app should look when you run it:

## Structure of this code repo 

#1. App hierarchy
I built this app to practice React, so one of my main focus points during this project was how parent-child components in React work, as well as how data is passed on from parent components to child components. The parent component in this project is "App.js" and this is a summary of the data it passes on to its children:
